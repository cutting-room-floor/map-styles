== MAPBOX STYLES =======================================================

This is a collection of Mapnik style definitions that you can use and 
modify to create your own custom maps. Each subdirectory contains:

  * A Mapnik XML map definition (.map.xml)
    This is the final file that is output by Cascadenik and gets sent to
    the render server.
  
  * A Cascadenik map definition (.mml) and stylesheet (.mss)
    These are the recommended files to edit if you wish to make changes 
    to the style. Find more information about Cascadenik at 
    <http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/wiki/Cascadenik>
  
  * Any custom textures and/or icons the style may require (in a
    subdirectory name 'res')
    
  * A README.txt file containing a description of the style and a list 
    of third-party resources you will need to download.
